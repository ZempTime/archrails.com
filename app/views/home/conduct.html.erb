    Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any ArchRails event or communication channel. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the user group staff immediately. Staff will be introduced at the start of each session/be wearing nametags.

    We will contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.
