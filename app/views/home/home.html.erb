    <h2>What we do:</h2>
    <p>
      In the past, we've done the whole 'meetup' thing, complete with talks, sponsors, and all the other standard meetup fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you know what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after the talks, people would still stick around and talk for the next hour and a half. What happens are deep, interesting conversations about substantial topics, and this is actually the valuable part of the meetup.
    </p>
    <p>
      So nowadays, we've cut the cruft: every month we all meet up at the same time and place and dive into one or two topics that matter.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Next Meetup:</h2>
    <p>
      Meeting Thursday May 12th, 2016 at <a href="http://www.downtowntrex.org/">T-Rex</a> 5th Floor, 7:00 PM.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      <b>Discussion Topic:</b> Railsconf 2016 Breakdown
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time this meetup rolls around, many many hours of footage, talks and information will be available surrounding Railsconf 2016 online.
    </p>
    <p>
      What are the great talks worth watching? Anything happened worth knowing?
    </p>
    <p>
      And more broadly, from the entirety of the internet, what are the best programming talks you've ever seen? This is a wondrous opportunity to make a listicle.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
       <a href="http://www.meetup.com/arch-rails/events/230905677/">RSVP</a> to enter into the raffle for either cookies that my Mom
       makes, or a gag gift. Feel free to suggest other topics or gag gifts!
