    <h2>What we do:</h2>
    <p>
      In the past, we've done the whole 'meetup' thing, complete with talks, sponsors, and all the other standard meetup fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you know what?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after the talks, people would still stick around and talk for the next hour and a half. What happens are deep, interesting conversations about substantial topics, and this is actually the valuable part of the meetup.
    </p>
    <p>
      So nowadays, we've cut the cruft: every month we all meet up at the same time and place and dive into one or two topics that matter.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Next Meetup:</h2>
    <p>
      Meeting Thursday March 10th, T-Rex 5th Floor, then relocating downstairs
      to Over Under Bar.
    </p>

      <b>Discussion Topic:</b> During the last meetup, Josh Peck asked a great
      question: "What kind of offer would you leave your current job for?"
      His company, <%= link_to "Ikayzo", "http://www.ikayzo.com/" %>, is
      expanding from Hawaii into St. Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      How often does a company swing into town and ask, "hey...what kind of place
      would you want to work for?" Having an answer to this is great for
      developers, great for companies, great for everyone. So that's what this
      time around is about:
    </p>
    <p>
      What <i>would</i> you leave your current gig for? What do you value in a place?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Basecamp "don't work more than 40 hours...live your life!," or the
      frenetic VC-powered "growth!" ?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
       RSVP to enter into the raffle for either cookies that my Mom
       makes, or a gag gift. Feel free to suggest other topics or gag gifts!
